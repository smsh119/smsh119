## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Assalamu Alaikum. I am S.M. Shuzatul Hoque. I am a student of  Information and Communication Engineering at the University of Rajshahi. I am a competitive programmer. The languages I use in competitive programming are C and C++. I am also a Web Developer and a Game Developer. I know HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, Javascript and can design and develop a complete website quiet well. I develop games using the game engine called Unity. I have also trained myself with unity based C# to develop games using unity. I am good at graphics design. I can work with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator quite well. I truly believe that there is no ending of knowledge and there is always much more to learn. So I always welcome new ideas and new things to learn in my way to success.
